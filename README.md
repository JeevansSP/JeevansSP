- 👋 Hi, I’m @JeevansSP
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, SQL, C++, shell scripting, Azure (AZ-900 certified), Kubernetes, Flask ,Docker, API development and Tableau 
- 🌱 I’m currently Working as the Lead API Engineer , my work includes setup up and management of a powerful multi-parallel-processing engine
      (presto/trino) which reduced data query time by 10 times, implemented Single-Sign-On and role-
      based access control for the above engine, optimized existing APIs with concurrency and multi-threading
      which reduced response times by an average of 5 times, built a visualization tool to track the data
      life-cycle of a given data-product, implemented distributed caching with cache update feature for scalability,
      all in an agile environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python based open source projects, literally any project i just want to make my mark in the open-source world :)
