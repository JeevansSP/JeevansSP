      (presto/trino) which reduced data query time by 10 times, implemented Single-Sign-On and role-
      based access control for the above engine, optimized existing APIs with concurrency and multi-threading
      which reduced response times by an average of 5 times, built a visualization tool to track the data
      life-cycle of a given data-product, implemented distributed caching with cache update feature for scalability,
      all in an agile environment.
